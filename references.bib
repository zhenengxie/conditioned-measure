	abstract = {We prove a metric space scaling limit for a critical random graph with independent and identically distributed degrees having power-law tail behaviour with exponent \${\textbackslash}alpha+1\$, where \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}in (1,2)\$. The limiting components are constructed from random \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$-trees encoded by the excursions above its running infimum of a process whose law is locally absolutely continuous with respect to that of a spectrally positive \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-stable L{\textbackslash}'evy process. These spanning \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$-trees are measure-changed \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-stable trees. In each such \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$-tree, we make a random number of vertex-identifications, whose locations are determined by an auxiliary Poisson process. This generalises results which were already known in the case where the degree distribution has a finite third moment (a model which lies in the same universality class as the Erd{\textbackslash}H\{o\}s--R{\textbackslash}'enyi random graph) and where the role of the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-stable L{\textbackslash}'evy process is played by a Brownian motion.},
